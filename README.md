Key Takeaways From Data
- Homefield Advantage exists, refer to pie chart with home teams having more wins. Explain what homefield advantage is and why it can cause more home teams to win.
- Possession is positively correlated to win percentage. Mention bar graph and the seperation into bins, higher amounts of possession leads to greater chances to win (win percentage).
- Possession is positively correlated to shots. Keeping the ball for longer eventually allows you to have more attacking chances and therefore more shots. Explanation for why possession is so important, because it generates more attacking chances that can determine who wins the game.
- Shot difference is positively correlated to win percentage. Greater shot difference, higher chance that team wins. More attack and shots lead to greater oppurtunities for a goal and therefore increase your chance to win. Relate this to possession. Possession leads to more shots, more shots typically correlates to greater shot difference and this greater shot difference increases the team's chance to win.
- Less fouls are typically better until the 8-11 range where this is the perfect amount. Less than this, and its actually worse. This is interesting as most poeple would assume that the less fouls your team commits the more likely you're able to win but there is actually a sweet spot for aggression. You should still maintain a decent amount of aggression but just dont overcommit fouls.
