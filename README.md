Soccer UEFA European Championship Data Analysis and Predictions

Key Takeaways From Data
- Homefield Advantage exists, pie chart shows home teams having a greater win percentage than away teams. This could be due to the greater amounts of fans that show up to support their home teams and the positive effects this support can provide for the team's morale.
- Possession is positively correlated to win percentage. Possession vs Win Percentage bar graphs showed that the greater amount of possession that a home or away team had, the greater percent chance there was for them to win the game.
- Possession is positively correlated to shots. Keeping the ball for longer eventually allows you to have more attacking chances and therefore more shots. Provides a reason as to why possession is crucial to win games.
- Shot difference is positively correlated to win percentage. The greater the shot difference is between teams, the higher chance that the team with more shots wins. More shots lead to greater oppurtunities for a goal and therefore increase your chance to win.
- Less fouls are typically better until the 8-11 fouls range where this is the perfect amount in a game. Less than this, and its actually worse. This is interesting as most poeple would assume that the less fouls your team commits the more likely you're able to win but there is actually a sweet spot for aggression. You should still maintain a decent amount of aggression but just dont overcommit fouls.
- Logistic Regression was used in our project to be able to predict whether a team would be able to win or not with 3 variables that you can enter with values. These variables were shots on target, possession, and fouls.
